# Ridge Regression

### Motivation

At its core, Ridge Regression attempts to add in further complexity into [OLS \(Ordinary Least Squares\)](../../engineering/system-analysis/least-squares.md) to reduce variance at the compromise of slightly increased bias. AKA, fitting the training data a little worse in order to properly generalize and have better performance on test data.
