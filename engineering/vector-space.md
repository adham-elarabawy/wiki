# Vector Space

A vector space is simply a set of vectors that obey the following constraints:

1. Closed under vector addition \(the result of adding any two vectors from the space should also be in the space\).
2. Closed under scalar multiplication \(the result of multiplying any vector in the space with any nonzero scalar should also be in the space\).
3. Commutativity $$X + Y = Y + X$$
4. Associativity of vector addition $$(X + Y) + Z = X + (Y + Z)$$
5. Additive Identity $$0 + X = X + 0 = X$$
6. Existence of additive inverse $$X + (-X) = 0$$
7. Associativity of scalar multiplication $$r(sX) = (rs)X$$
8. Distributivity of vector sums $$(r+s) X = rX + sX$$
9. Scalar multiplication identity $$1X = X$$
