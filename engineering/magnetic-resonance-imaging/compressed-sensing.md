# Compressed Sensing MRI

### Primary Objective

Reconstruct signals & images from fewer measurements. MRI scanners take a very long time to scan -- we want to reduce this amount of time by sampling as little as we possibly need & then reconstruct the signal afterwards.

### What makes this CS-applicable?

1. Medical Imagery is naturally compressible by spare coding in an appropriate transfer domain \([Wavelet Transform](../wavelet-transform.md)\).
2. MRI scanners inherently obtain encoded samples -- as opposed to direct pixel samples.
