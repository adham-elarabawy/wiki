# Hilbert Space

### What is it?

It's basically a special type of vector space that has a few more additional properties.

It satisfies the following criterion:

1. A Hilbert Space is a linear [vector space](vector-space.md) \(obeys the same constraints\).
2. It has an [inner product operation](inner-products.md) that satisfies certain conditions:
   * Conjugate Symmetry: $$<v_1, v_2> = <v_2, v_1>^*$$
     * The inner product of two vectors is equal to the complex conjugate of the inner product of their reversed order.
