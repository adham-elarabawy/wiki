# Adham's Wiki

![](.gitbook/assets/banner.png)

This wiki acts as a culmination of my formalized notes for:

* classes
* projects
* anything I find to be documentation-worthy along the way

Here is the current mapping between section notes and their topics of interest:

| Section | Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| System Analysis | [EECS16A](https://eecs16a.org/), [EECS16B](https://eecs16b.org/) | General EE + system analysis techniques |
| Machine Learning | [MLAB](https://ml.berkeley.edu/) | From bare-bones classical ML to Deep Neural Nets |
| Computer Science | [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/), [CS61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es/) | Python, Java, Git |
| Math | [Discrete Mathematics](https://www.eecs70.org/) | Calculus, DiffEq, Discrete Mathematics, Probability Theory |
