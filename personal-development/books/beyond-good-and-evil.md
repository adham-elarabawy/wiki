# Beyond Good & Evil

### Christopher Janaway's Introduction

> Our essence is 'will to life', a drive to survive, reproduce, possess, and consume. But things constantly go against our will, a fact that inevitably brings disappointment, frustration, boredom, pain, and grief -- life is suffering.

This analysis of Schopenhauer's primary principles was a little depressing, but I definitely find solace in it. I'm not sure I wholly agree with this, but I definitely empathize with it. 

Schopenhauer's solution to this was to try to achieve a higher consciousness in which we leave behind willing altogether -- which he calls the '_negation of the will to life_'.

### Truth

Nietzsche says, a false opinion or judgement can sometimes preserve and enhance our life more than a true one. It's not that there is no such thing as judgements being true or false -- rather it's that false ones can be more valuable than true ones. We might be better off believing things that are false, and not finding out that they are false. Fundamentally, this is the notion of blissful ignorance -- but Nietzsche takes this further by drawing parallels to religion. God is people's truth -- did it matter whether or not that their belief was true/false?

The problem in Nietzsche's eyes was that the european culture that promoted christianity was also fundamentally rooted in the virtue of truth -- which _could prove_ to be an inherent contradiction. This is a possible contradiction that kept Nietzsche at bay from christianity.

My understanding of Nietzsche's conclusions about truth are that he's skeptical that the pursuit of truth is at all genuine or necessary. He doesn't believe that there is a fundamental drive towards knowledge for knowledge's sake -- which ends up just being him criticizing current and past philosophers for not properly disclaiming their prejudices, which end up being the 'detached' principles that they perpetuate \(which is just them projecting their internal prejudices on to the masses\). He apparently despised these 'bloodless \_\_\_\_\_'.
