# The Trial \(Kafka\)

### Initial Thoughts

Reading _The Trial_ was frustrating. Besides Kafka's seemingly mellow writing \(which can reasonably be attributed to translation nuances\) and the overall absurdity framing the entire book, I was troubled by the similarities I found between myself and 'K.'.

Sure, I've never been arrested before \(let alone arrested for no reason\), and I'm no banker. But something about seeing some of myself in K.'s simultaneous bewilderment and \(contradicting\) acceptance was quite uncomfortable. Joseph is faced with a blatantly ridiculous situation, which he attempts to resolve using equally absurd methods -- somehow convincing himself that approaching the nonsensical with half-ass logic would end his problems. But in this same process, he wastes away his guaranteed -- albeit temporary -- freedom in order to justify and reason with absurdity. 

Equally frustrating to me was K.'s conditional self-awareness. He kept reiterating how well-respected and intelligent he was -- yet he rarely utilized any of the above to rid himself of his predicament. I found myself clenching my jaw in disappointment and mild anger while reading the scene where he chooses to spend a few hours with his lawyer's flirty assistant instead of with his lawyer and a potentially powerful judge.

#### He's given up on his situation? That's the point, isn't it?

By the end of the book, I wanted K. to be guilty. And I think I've now come to the conclusion that he actually is. Joseph had every chance to seize control of his life -- he could take advantage of his \(or his Uncle's\) social connections, bribe, flee, escape, _anything._ But instead, he chose to let himself be dominated by society -- mindlessly abiding by the publicly arbitrary rules set forth _by the same institution_ responsible for the __absurdity he was challenging. He was shot down "like a dog" because that's what he was to the society he served: a dog that obeys commands thoughtlessly. 

I'm not saying he deserved to be shot down -- that's painfully cruel. But he's also not devoid of responsibility for the circumstances of his death.

> But because without knowing the nature of the charge and all its possible ramifications, his entire life, down to the smallest actions and events, would have to be called into mind, described, and examined from all sides. And what a sad job that was. Perhaps someday after retirement, it might provide a suitable occupation for a mind turned childish, and help to while away the lengthening days. But now... every hour went speeding by, and when he wished to enjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man, now he was supposed to start writing his petition.

I don't think it's actually all that sad. I won't speak for other people, but I know I definitely spend a good amount of time contemplating retrospectively -- sometimes thinking about how different my life would be if I had changed a single action in the past. Although, I'm generally thinking about that in a curious manner, not a melancholy one.

I like how Kafke sublty and elegantly emphasized time's nonlinearity in this page though. He goes from off-handedly mentioning growing old "while\[-ing\] away lengthening days" to K.'s concerns about wasting away the most valuable time of his life writing a petition. +1 on that feeling.

### Conclusion

I'm honestly a bit tentative to come to a definitive conclusion about this book. It almost feels like I'm tainting the canvas that Kafka elegantly **smeared** with his broad brush. Although, I don't think Kafka will mind. If anything, I think my conclusion urges me to not care what Kafka thinks.
