# MF Doom

### My final thoughts

 MF Doom has always been one of those artists whose discography I never really delved into despite knowing about them for a while. I finally invested some time to give some of his songs a try \(with the help of @Sarah Kadous\), and I was very pleasantly surprised. As you'll likely be able to tell from the song reviews below, I particularly enjoyed his consistent rap cadence, but didn't necessarily find myself coming back to the songs with especially weird beats/production. Regardless, I can easily understand why he was considered to be so influential to the current state of the music industry right now \(and I can certainly appreciate it\). Rest in peace.

### Knock Knock

I really liked the first few features, but the synthesized voice that kicks in ~2 minutes in kinda caught me off guard. I’m a big fan of the MF DOOM cadence, which makes me want to hear some more uninterrupted verses. 

### America’s Most Blunted

This was the first track that really gave me a taste of how long it takes for these songs to kick in. The slow intro really contrasts the DOOM cadence \(which I so very like\). It definitely took a bit more attention to keep up with all the different voices intersecting each other + the chopped up “America’s Most Blunted” line, but overall, I loved this track. Didn’t really like the outro though -- would interrupt a playlist flow imo.

### Curls

I LOVED this song. He’s quick to ride the beat, keeps the cadence relatively consistent, and he has a ridiculously satisfying rhyme structure. Short n’ sweet.

### Rapp Snitch Knishes

Definitely enjoyed this one. It had a pretty satisfying chorus that got stuck in my head all day, and it felt like the feature was a really good fit. Sometimes, I don’t like when the features sound too much like the original artist, because it seems like they don’t really add anything unique to the song, but in this case, I found the feature to be a great compliment to DOOM.

### Mean the Most

Most of this song’s appeal to me was because of the unique beat. I’m a big fan of when an instrument dominates the beat \(especially when it’s piano\). Bishop Nehru had nice verses, but his chorus wasn’t especially strong \(didn’t like his singing voice\).

### Money Folder \(Remix\)

The tempo of this song was a bit upbeat, so I enjoyed it. The beat was a bit too funky for me though. 

### My Favorite Ladies

LOVED this one. Beat was simple, which gave DOOM a chance to let his lyricism dominate. 

### Voices, Pt. 1

I liked this one a lot, despite it feeling like DOOM was falling off the beat sometimes \(since the beat was a bit weird\). I appreciated the concise outro. Definitely added to my liked songs though.

### Arabic Gum

Not a big fan of the chopped up sounds, so this one didn’t really resonate well with me.

### Hoe Cakes

The beat made me giggle a couple times, but other than that, I liked the way that DOOM rode on and off the beat. Beat was a tad incessant though.

### Fancy Clown

This song has to be my favorite one in this playlist. The mellowed-out intro vocals were PERFECT -- I ended up replaying this song at least 5 times in a row. Doom did his thing too.

### Rainbows

I’m not a huge fan of MF DOOM spending an entire track experimenting with his vocals, since I’m generally drawn to his mercilessly consistent cadence when he raps. So this one was a nice groove, but didn’t make me want to replay it much.

### The Chocolate Conquistadores

I didn’t think I’d like this one because of the lack of vocals/verses, but I actually thoroughly enjoyed the 7 minute instrumental adventure.

### Darkness

The verse starting ~2:30 was beautiful. Didn’t particularly enjoy the extra verse + beat repetition at the end, since it tired me out by the end of the song. Other than that, I was a big fan.
