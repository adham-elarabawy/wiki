# Childish Gambino

### My final thoughts

Childish Gambino is among my top 10 artists of all time. His range is genuinely impressive \(rapping, acting, soulful singing, humor\). Whenever he releases a new project, I'm not quite sure which facet of Donald Glover I'm going to get -- but I'm always sure I'll be \(happily\) intellectually stimulated. 

### Awaken, My Love

Such a soulful album. The first time I heard it, it vaguely hinted at Curtis Mayfield's music, which made all the more sense when Childish Gambino credited Mayfield with inspiration for the album. 

Favorite Songs \(no order\):

* Baby Boy
* Redbone
* Zombies
* Me and Your Mama
* Have Some Love

I can't wait to play **Baby Boy** when I have kids and for it to hit different.

### Kauai

This album is definitely one to listen to when I have someone in mind. Some of the lyrics just perfectly capture infatuation, in a weirdly up-tempo manner. The main downside is that I've over-listened to all of these songs.

Favorite Songs \(no order\):

* Pop Thieves \(Make It Feel Good\)
* V. 3005 - Beach Picnic Version
* Sober

I can't wait to play **Pop Thieves** for someone who deserves the lyrics.
