# Smino

### My Final Thoughts

My most listened to song of 2020 was Smino's _Amphetamine_. Smino's songs have this quadfecta of perfect production, seamless flow, confusingly satisfying cadence, and unique voice. I honestly can't get enough of his music. Although. I do tend to like **blkswn** and all his discography that predates it more than his more recent stuff.

I'm generally a big fan of cohesive albums. The cohesiveness doesn't necessarily have to be thematic, I just enjoy _any_ cohesiveness \(even if it is just a similar sound\). Smino likes to manipulate pronunciation a lot, which when coupled with his weird tempo and impressive vocabulary, makes for a ridiculously unique sound. The cohesiveness in this album comes in the form of the beats/production, since they're all relatively similar.

Also the album art is kinda amazing.

Favorite songs \(no order\):

* Amphetamine
* Anita
* Glass Flows
* Father Son Holy Smoke
* Wild Irish Roses

### Kajun

Oh my god is this song an absolute gem. The beat is so simple and gives Smino so much space to shine and take full creative liberty with voice experimentation. 10/10 song. Mediocre production, but who cares.

### Oxygen

The beat. His cadence. The production. The lyrics. The adlibs. Everything works perfectly in unison to get the song's theme across. This is the level of cohesiveness that I thoroughly appreciate. amazing.

### Runnin

Same notes as [Oxygen](smino.md#oxygen), but this time for running instead of breathing. amazing.

### Ciabatta

This is a pretty old one, so I didn't expect Smino to have a refined sound. I'm not a big fan of the beat, but it's refreshing to see how much Smino has grown over time, and how much of a difference good production makes. I'll give this to him though: the chorus is absurdly catchy.
